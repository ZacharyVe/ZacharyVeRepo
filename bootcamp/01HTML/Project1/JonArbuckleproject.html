        <p>Hi there everyone! My name is <u>Jon Arbuckle</u>. I am 30 years old and I am a cartoonist that lives in Munic, Indiana. I am the proud owner of a cat named <strong>Garfield</strong> and a dog named <strong>Odie</strong>. Garfiled is fat lazy and loves to eat, while Odie is a dog without a brain.</p>
        <P>Although my pets Drive me crazy, I cant imagine a life without them.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I spend about half my time going to the grocery store to buy enough food to feed Garfield. I have to make sure to buy all of Garfield's favorite foods, or else he'll get grumpy.</p>
