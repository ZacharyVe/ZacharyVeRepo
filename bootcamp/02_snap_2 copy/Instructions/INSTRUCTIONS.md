# INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Make sure you put your phone on silent

2. Git clone this `Students_Sep_2020_Reviews` folder to your computer. If you already have it from a previous exam, then `git pull` within this repository's folder to update your local repository.

3. Copy this `02_snap_2` folder over to your personal repository within github.com/ACCSoftwareBootcamp, so you may edit the contents there and commit/push them for grading.

   For example, get the questions from

   `github.com/ACCSoftwareBootcamp/Students_Sep_2020_Reviews/02_snap_2`

   And push your answers to

   `github.com/ACCSoftwareBootcamp/YOUR_GITHUB_HANDLE/02_snap_2`

4. There's a folder for each question. You can create additional files within the folder if it helps you arrive at an answer and demonstrate your knowledge.

5. This review is in 2 parts:

   1. **Multiple choice questions (65%)**. These questions have equal weight. You only need to answer 10 out of the 13 questions on this quiz.  Please mark the ones you skip as "SKIPPED" or else they will be considered for grading and may lower your score.

   2. **Practical (35%)**. There is one practical question you must answer to receive a passing grade. Please attempt it since partial credit is given!

6. This review is open book. You may use all references available to you to answer the questions.

7. If a code snippet on the review has a bug, please feel free to fix it and then answer.

8. Please `git add`, `git commit`, `git push` your answers to your private ACCSoftwareBootcamp repository. There will be no grace time given after 10:00 am. Hence, please do complete as much as you can and commit/push your answers on or before time.

### INTEGRITY:

Some ground rules you are expected to follow:

- No sharing of direct or indirect answers.
- Absolutely no sharing of answer code.
- No sharing of url references, your peers can web search too.
- Any clarification from instructors should be posted on Slack under the channel **#\_reviews** so that all students have access to the same clarification.

### EVALUATION CRITERIA:

1. Evidence of your ability to follow instructions.

2. Evidence of your ability to explain your answer(s) through comments within code or through free form text as requested(!)

3. Evidence of understanding of the underlying concepts related to the question.

4. Does your code work, where applicable?

### PASSING CRITERIA & SCORING STRATEGIES

1. 70% of overall score is needed for overall success.

2. You may take up to 1 hour and 30 minutes on the review day to complete the review. Please remember to commit/push your answers within the time allotted. You may complete your answers for learning and experimentation purposes, at a later time. Your answers committed before the specified time will be evaluated.

3. This exam tests your knowledge, but more so tests your understanding of the concepts. If you do not know the answer, allocate a few minutes and try to understand what is being asked, research it, and explain in brief why you chose the answer.
